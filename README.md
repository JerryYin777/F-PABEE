# F-PABEE
**This is our paper "F-PABEE: Flexible-patience-based Early Exit for Single-label and." Multi-label text Classification Tasks, paper is now included in EMNLP 2022 Findings**

You will see our article on the [EMNLP 2022 official website](https://2022.emnlp.org/) in a while

## Contribution
* F-PABEE outperforms existing early exit models such as Brexit and PABEE on both single-label and multi-label tasks.

* F-PABEE performs well on different PLMs such as ALBERT.

* Ablation studies show that as a similarity measure, Jenson-Shannon divergence works best for our F-PABEE method.
